## Aggregator/Webscraper
Small project, which scrapes html from a specified url.
It then applies it to the applications, own index.html file using the /api/scrape endpoint.
It gathers pictures from Picsum API, to change all img tags to pictures from the api.

**How it went**

It was a fun idea, but i didn't really find any websites good for practicing.
I wanted to also scrape css, but as im supposed to upload this to github, it didnt feel right.
Didnt really need to use mvc here. No need for a model, as there was no data structure or database involved.


 **Resources used**
 
-[Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)

**How to run**
Change the url in ScrapingController.cs.
In terminal use ```dotnet run```
