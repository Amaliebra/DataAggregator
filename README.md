## Aggregator/Webscraper
Small project, which scrapes html from a specified url.
It then applies it to the applications, own index.html file using the /api/scrape endpoint.
It gathers pictures from Picsum API, to change all img tags to pictures from the api.
**How it went**
It was a fun idea, but i didn't really find any websites good for practicing.
